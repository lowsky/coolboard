# Local GraphQL server based on Prisma

To run you local server, you will have to run these commands in a
terminal in this sub-folder (after a `cd server`).

Based on Boilerplate for an Advanced GraphQL Server

## Features

- **Scalable GraphQL server:** The server uses [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) which is based on Apollo Server & Express
- **GraphQL database:** Includes GraphQL database binding to [Prisma](https://www.prismagraphql.com) (running on MySQL)
- **Authentication**: Signup and login workflows are ready to use for your users
- **Tooling**: Out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) & [query performance tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing)
- **Extensible**: Simple and flexible [data model](./database/datamodel.prisma) – easy to adjust and extend
- **No configuration overhead**: Preconfigured [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-config) setup
- **Realtime updates**: Support for GraphQL subscriptions

### Commands

After having docker started on you local machine you can deploy _locally_.

* `yarn start:lambda` starts netlify-lambda based GraphQL server on `http://localhost:9000/graphql`
* `yarn start` starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000`
* `yarn dev` starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000` _and_ opens GraphQL Playground
* `yarn playground` opens the GraphQL Playground for the `projects` from [`.graphqlconfig.yml`](./.graphqlconfig.yml)
* `yarn prisma <subcommand>` gives access to local version of Prisma CLI (e.g. `yarn prisma deploy`)

> **Note**: We recommend that you're using `yarn dev` during development as it will give you access to the GraphQL API or your server (defined by the [application schema](./src/apiSchema.js)) as well as to the Prisma API directly (defined by the [Prisma database schema](./src/generated/prisma.graphql)). If you're starting the server with `yarn start`, you'll only be able to access the API of the application schema.

Check the local `.env` config file with the parameters needed to specify the prisma cloud server host, authentication, etc.
